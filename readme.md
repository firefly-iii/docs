## Support the development of Firefly III

Firefly III is a side gig. With your sponsorship or support, I can spend more time on Firefly III. So, if you like Firefly III, and if it helps you save lots of money, why not send me a dime for every dollar saved! ü•≥

OK, that was a joke. But for real, when you feel Firefly III made your life better, please consider contributing as a sponsor. Please check out my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jc5) and [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/JC5) page for more information. You can also [buy me a ‚òïÔ∏è coffee at ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/Q5Q5R4SH1) or send something my way using [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/JC5). Thank you for your consideration.

### Sponsorships

Firefly III is sponsored by LamdaTest. Their support allows me to test Firefly III more easily and introduce even fewer bugs with every release.
