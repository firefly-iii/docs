# Groups

Some things in Firefly III can be divided into groups. At the moment this applies only to piggy banks, but the list is slowly growing.

## Features

Groups are a very basic visual divider of objects. For piggy banks, you could divide them up into two groups: "large savings" and "small things".

## Managing groups

There are dedicated pages \(listed under `/groups/index`\) to edit and delete groups. You cannot create groups on this page; groups are created whenever you edit an object and set a group.

## Deleting groups

Groups are _automatically_ deleted when no objects exist in the group. If you remove the final object from a group \(for example, a single piggy bank\) the group is gone.

## Managing objects in groups

This feature is pretty new and for the time being, you can't do much with them. If you have good ideas just [let me know on GitHub](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues)!
