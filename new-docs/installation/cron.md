# Cron jobs

Firefly III supports several feature that requires you to run a cron job:

1. [Recurring transactions](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/advanced-concepts/recurring). Firefly III can automatically create transactions for you.  
  If Firefly III is to actually create these recurring transactions for you, someone or something must check every single day if a new transaction is due to be created.
2. [Automatic budgeting](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/concepts/budgets). Firefly III can automatically set your budgets for you.
3. [Telemetry](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/support/telemetry). When enabled (telemetry is **opt-in**), Firefly III will submit its telemetry data.

## Cron job that calls a command

If you are a bit of a Linux geek you can set up a cron job easily by running `crontab -e` on the command line. Some users may have to run `sudo crontab -u www-data -e` so the correct user will be referred to.

The content of the cron job must be as follows:

```   
# cron job for Firefly III
0 3 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/firefly-iii/artisan firefly-iii:cron
```

Of course, you must make sure to replace `/usr/bin/php` with *your* path to PHP and replace `/var/www/firefly-iii/` with the path to *your* Firefly III installation.

If you do this, Firefly III will generate the recurring transactions each night at 3AM. 

## Cron job that requests a page

If for some reason you can't call scripts like this you can also use a tool called cURL which is available on most (if not all) linux systems. 

The content of the cron job must be as follows:

```
# cron job for Firefly III using cURL
0 3 * * * curl https://demo.firefly-iii.org/cron/run/<token>
```

Of course you must replace the URL with the URL of your own Firefly III installation. The `<token>` value can be found on your `/profile` under the "Command line token" header. This will prevent others from spamming your cron job URL.

## Make IFTTT do it

If you can't run a cron job, you can always make [If This, Then That (IFTTT)](https://ifttt.com) do it for you. This will only work if your Firefly III installation can be reached from the internet. Here's what you do.

Login to IFTTT (or register a new account) and create a new applet:

![Make a new applet](images/ifttt-applet.png)

You will get this screen. Select "This":

![Select "This"](images/ifttt-this.png)

Select "Date & Time":

![Select "Date and time"](images/ifttt-dt.png)

Select "Every day at":

![Select "Every day at"](images/ifttt-eda.png)

Set the time to 3AM:

![Time to 3AM](images/ifttt-4am.png)

Click on "That":

![Click on "That"](images/ifttt-that.png)

Use the search bar to search for "Webhooks".

![Search for "Webhooks"](images/ifttt-webhooks.png)

Click on "make a web request"

![Click on "make a web request"](images/ifttt-request.png)

Enter the URL in the following format:

`https://your-firefly-installation.com/cron/run/<token>`

Of course you must replace the URL with the URL of your own Firefly III installation. The `<token>` value can be found on your `/profile` under the "Command line token" header. This will prevent others from spamming your cron job URL.

![The result of setting up IFTTT](images/ifttt-result.png)

Press Finish to finish up. You can change the title of the IFTTT applet into something more descriptive, if you want to.

You will see a final overview

Press Finish, and you're done!

## Cron jobs in Docker

The Docker image does *not* support cron jobs. This is by design, because Docker images should do as little as possible. There are several solutions.

### Call the cron job from outside the Docker container

Use any tool or system to call the URL as documented above.

### Call the cron job from the host system

The command would be something like this:

```
0 3 * * * docker exec --user www-data <container> /usr/local/bin/php /var/www/firefly-iii/artisan firefly-iii:cron
```

Replace `<container>` with the container ID or with `firefly_iii_app` in case of Docker compose. If you want, you can replace `<container>` with this piece of code that will automatically insert the correct container ID. Keep in mind, it may need some fine tuning!

```
$(docker container ls -a -f name=firefly --format="{{.ID}}")
```

### Run an image that calls the cron job

Here's an example:

```
docker create --name=Firefly-Cronjob alpine sh -c "echo \"0 3 * * * wget <Firefly III URL>/cron/run/<TOKEN>\" | crontab - && crond -f -L /dev/stdout"
```

Of course, replace `<Firefly III URL>` with your Firefly III URL and replace `<TOKEN>` with your command line token. You can find it in your profile.

### Expand the docker-compose file

```
cron:
  image: alpine
  command: sh -c "echo \"0 3 * * * wget https://<Firefly III URL>/cron/run/<TOKEN>\" | crontab - && crond -f -L /dev/stdout"
```

Of course too you replace `<Firefly III URL>` with your Firefly III URL and replace `<TOKEN>` with your command line token. You can find it in your profile.
