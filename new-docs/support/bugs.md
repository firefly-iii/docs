# Reporting bugs

First of all: thank you for reporting a bug instead of ditching the tool altogether. Every bug report is taken seriously and I appreciate your input.

If you find a bug, please take the time and see if the demo site is also suffering from this bug; include as many log files and details as you think are necessary. Bugs have a lot of priority!

You can send the bug info [to me by email](mailto:james@firefly-iii.org) or by [opening a ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues).

## Errors in translations

If you see a spelling error, grammatical error or a weird translation in your language, please join [the CrowdIn project](https://crowdin.com/project/firefly-iii). There you can submit your translations and fixes. The GitHub repository will download these automatically and they will be included in the next release.
