## What do I do with people who pay me back?

Let's say you have a budget for "Going out", worth € 100. You go out with some friends and you offer to pay the bill, expecting your friends to pay you back later. The total bill is € 120 with your three friends owing you € 90 in total. So although you spent € 120 (overspending your budget with € 20), your actual costs are a mere € 30. What to do?

It's important that Firefly III won't do anything. You can't correct your budget with income, so your budget will appear to have been overspent with € 20. But you can correct this yourself. How exactly is entirely up to you.

1. You increase the budget with € 90 to a total of € 190. This means you still have € 70 to spend (€ 190 - € 120) but your budget is changed.
2. You edit the expense so it lists € 30 instead of € 120. This means you don't have to change the budget, but also means you ignore the deposits from your friends.

It's up to you what you do. *Personally*, I do nr. 2. It means that Firefly III shows me what I actually spent, and my own income isn't skewed by what people pay me back.

## What should I do when I close a real life asset account?

To close an account in Firefly III, do the following.

1. Make sure the balance is zero by transferring out or withdrawing the final balance.
2. Edit the account (look for the pencil icon or use the ellipsis-menu) and remove the checkbox next to **Active**.

You can find the inactive asset account on a special page: `/inactive-accounts/asset`.
