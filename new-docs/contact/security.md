# Security

Firefly III should be run on a TLS enabled host \(`https://`\) even when running locally. Please remember that this is open source software under active development, and it is in no way guaranteed to be safe or secure.

## Security features

* By default, Firefy III only supports one user registration. You can disable this in the administration.
* You should use disk- and database encryption whenever possible.
* Firefly III supports 2 factor authentication, check your preferences.

## Security bugs?

If you find something that compromises the security of Firefly III, you should [send me a message](mailto:james@firefly-iii.org) as soon as possible. These issues will be fixed immediately.

You can use my [PGP key](https://keybase.io/jc5) for extra security. My [GitHub commits](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/commits/main) are almost always signed with this key. For more, see contact information.
