If you have your own (virtual) web server you can use this guide to install Firefly III. You will some ingredients prepared already.





Ingredients
-----------
You need a working LAMP, LEMP or WAMP stack. If you don't have one, search the web to find out how to get one. Make sure you're running PHP 7.2. There are many tutorials that will help you install one. Here are some Google queries to help you.

1. `Install a LAMP stack with PHP 7.2 <https://www.google.com/search?q=lamp+stack+php+7.2>`_
2. `Upgrade Ubuntu PHP 7.2 <https://www.google.com/search?q=upgrade+ubuntu+php+7.2>`_
3. `PHP 7.2 raspberry pi <https://www.google.nl/search?q=PHP+7.2+raspberry+pi>`_

If you wish to use another database such as SQLite or Postgres, please check out the :ref:`Server FAQ <faqselfhosted>`.

You need a (MySQL) database and credentials for a user that can access that database. Firefly III creates its own tables. Avoid using the root user.

Several users have created specific guides for their OS and database combination

1. `CentOS 7, with nginx and PHP 7.2 <https://old.reddit.com/r/FireflyIII/comments/825n4l/centos_7_nginx_installation_guide/>`_
2. `Ubuntu Server 16.04LTS with nginx and PHP 7.2 <https://old.reddit.com/r/FireflyIII/comments/8thxuu/fireflyiii_on_ubuntu_server_1604lts_nginx_php72/>`_
3. `Ubuntu Server 18.04 with nginx and PHP 7.2 <https://gist.github.com/philthynz/ec04833a8e39c7f7d1b0d33cb4197a95>`_


Preparing your server
---------------------

Extra packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the following PHP modules:

* PHP BCMath Arbitrary Precision Mathematics
* PHP Internationalization extension
* PHP Curl
* PHP Zip
* PHP GD
* PHP XML
* PHP MBString
* PHP LDAP

You can search the web to find out how to install these modules. Some may be installed already depending on your system. Use ``phpinfo()`` to find out.

Installing composer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have sudo rights (try ``sudo ls``) you can install composer using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

Verify the installation of composer using the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

   composer -v

If you have no sudo rights, you can simply `download composer <https://getcomposer.org/download/>`_ with the instructions under the header "manual download". Use ``php composer.phar`` instead of ``composer`` in the instructions ahead.

This concludes the server preparations. If you're having trouble with (parts of) this step, please check out the :ref:`Server FAQ <faqselfhosted>`.

Installing Firefly III
----------------------

Main command
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Browse to ``/var/www`` which is probably the directory where your web server is configured to find its files.

Enter the following command. 

.. code-block:: bash

   composer create-project grumpydictator/firefly-iii --no-dev --prefer-dist firefly-iii <latest>


You should replace ``<latest>`` with the latest version, which you can find on the `Github release list <https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/releases>`_.

If this gives an error because of access rights, prepend the command with ``sudo``. Then fix the access rights:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data firefly-iii
   sudo chmod -R 775 firefly-iii/storage

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``firefly-iii`` directory you will find a `.env` file. Open this file using your favorite editor. There are instructions what to do in this file.

Initialize the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step is very important, because Firefly III needs a database to work with and it will tell you whether or not your configuration is correct. Run the following command in the Firefly III directory.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
   php artisan firefly:upgrade-database
   php artisan firefly:verify
   php artisan passport:install

Now you should be able to visit `http://localhost/firefly-iii/ <http://localhost/firefly-iii/public>`_ and see Firefly III.

If you're having trouble with (parts of) this step, please check out the :ref:`Server FAQ <faqselfhosted>`.


Pre php 7.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those of you unable to upgrade yet to php 7.2 you can run this command to install the last compatible version before this mandated requiredment:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer create-project grumpydictator/firefly-iii --no-dev --prefer-dist firefly-iii-downgrade 4.7.6
   
If downgrading make sure to point your webserver to the new location and copy over the .env file. E.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   cp firefly-iii/.env firefly-iii-downgrade/.env
   
You may need to reverse the last migration (don't do this in the downgrade)

.. code-block:: bash
   
   php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1
   
Rerun the check

.. code-block:: bash
   
   php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
   php artisan firefly:upgrade-database
   php artisan firefly:verify
   php artisan passport:install
