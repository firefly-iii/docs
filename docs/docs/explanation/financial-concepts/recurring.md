Firefly III features the ability to automatically create transactions, so you don't have to. These are called recurring transactions.

A recurring transaction can be a withdrawal, deposit or a transfer.

## So what is the difference between a subscription and a recurring transaction?

Most users use recurring transactions when they do not import data into Firefly III. Because then, it may be useful to have Firefly III create transactions automatically.

If you import data using (for example) CSV files, this is not necessary. You can just import the data and link it to a subscription.

Personally, I link recurring transactions to subscriptions. You can see the option for it when you create a recurring transaction.
