Firefly III supports as many currencies as you like. By default, it ships with a variety of currencies. You can add your own currencies if you're missing one. The currency code must be compliant with [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

Firefly III supports at most 8 decimals for currencies. This is due to system limits on most systems when it comes to math. In practice, this may mean you will not be able to add cryptocurrencies.
