# Financial administrations

Firefly III is working towards support for multiple financial administrations. This means that you will be able to keep track of multiple separated financial sets of data. For example, you could manage your personal finances and the finances you share with your partner in the same Firefly III installation.

Naturally, this means that you can share a financial administration, so two or more people work on the same set of records. This is not yet finished work, I'm still building this.

## Administration settings

For now, under the "Financial administrations" entry in the left hand menu (or `/administrations`), you can set the native currency for your administration. This is the currency that all your accounts and transactions will be in by default. You can also create transactions in any other currency, but this will be the default.

This setting, for those of you who are familiar with it, replaces the "default currency"  setting that was places under [Currencies](currencies.md) (`/currencies`).

Once this feature is finished, more information will be added to this page.
