# Data classification

In order to make sure you organize your transactions right, use the following guidelines to make sure the granularity of your transactions (and other data) is correct.

## Accounts

You should have one asset [account](../financial-concepts/accounts.md) per actual account that you have. If your bank supports sub-accounts, you can also make asset accounts for those.

Personally, I make separate *expense accounts* for each store and merchant I buy stuff from. So, bol.com, Albert Heijn, Zalando, are all separate expense accounts. The same applies to *revenue accounts*.

Optionally, you can lump all these expenses together under one expense account called "Daily shopping expenses", it's up to you.

I do the same thing for revenue accounts, to track where my money is coming from: "JobGiver Inc.", "GitHub", and friends that pay me back are all separate revenue accounts. 

One personal exception: I lump together all payments from payment request services. Famous ones include "Tikkie" and "Venmo". I organized a goodbye party for a colleague from work and I didn't really feel like creating or managing dozens of one-time revenue accounts. So now I just have one revenue account called "Tikkie".

## Budgets

Budgets are the only option you have that allows you to set an upper limit on your spending. So, track money in broad strokes using budgets: groceries, cost-of-living (rent etc), going out, car.

Tracking smaller things is possible (personal hygiene expenses, gardening tools) but does mean you have to budget for all these types of expenses.

Intermittent expenses (less than twice a month) are not really suited to be tracked in a budget. Use a catch-all budget like groceries or something encompassing like "everything else."

## Categories

Use categories to be more specific in the organization of your expenses. Within the scope of your budget if necessary. "Daily groceries", "personal hygiene" or "vegetables" are categories that are fine, and can be combined with a budget like "daily groceries."

You can't force a subset of categories for specific budgets though.

## Tags

Use tags to be judgy about your expenses. I have a tag `bad buy 2026`, and similar tags for previous years. As you can imagine, I track my bad buys using this tag. It's also possible to use the [product manager](https://github.com/JC5/product-manager/) or similar tools to organize your data in tags.

## Object groups

Object groups are a option for piggy banks and bills, and not used elsewhere. Use them to group things together.
