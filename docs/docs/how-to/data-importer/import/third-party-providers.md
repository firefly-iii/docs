# How to use third party data providers?

The Firefly III data importer supports several third party data providers to help you import your financial data into Firefly III.

On this page, you will find instructions on how to register for each data provider, and what the associated costs are, if any.

After you have registered, your best bet is to check out the [list of tutorials about data providers](../../../tutorials/data-importer/data-providers.md) and find your data provider to continue the import process.

## GoCardless

!!! note
    GoCardless is "shifting away" from their Bank Account Data products (aka the service you need for this to work). These instructions are only here for users who still have access to their GoCardless account.

GoCardless API access is paid, and they are a commercial organization. Please read and agree with all the terms the company may present you with. They have their own data usage and privacy policies, which you must read up on.

In the past, you could sign up for the GoCardless API on [their website](https://bankaccountdata.gocardless.com/signup). 

GoCardless supports [many PSD2-compliant banks in the EU and the UK](https://nordigen.com/en/coverage/) if you happen to live in these regions.
