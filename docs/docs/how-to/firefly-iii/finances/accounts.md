## Deleting accounts

If you delete an account, any associated transactions will be removed as well. If you're deleting an asset account, and you've transferred money between the current asset account and other asset accounts, you might see changed balances all around. Remember to correct this, if necessary. You can move the transactions to a new account if you wish to preserve them.
