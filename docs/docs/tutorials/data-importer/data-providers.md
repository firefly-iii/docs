# What are data providers?

When you are managing your finances with Firefly III, you don't want to enter all your transactions manually. The data importer can help you with that. It can [import CSV files](csv.md) which are provided by most (if not all) banks to import data into Firefly III.

## But I want more automation!

You're in luck! In the navigation (on most devices you will find this on the left side of your screen), you will find menu items for all currently supported data providers and how to use them to import data into Firefly III.
