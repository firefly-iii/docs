# Manage your mortgage

There are multiple ways to manage your mortgage. The method below focuses on ensuring all transactions are able to be part of a budget, and categorized.

## Create a mortgage account

Your mortgage loans should be created as Liability accounts. For more information on creating liability accounts, see [How to manage liabilities](../../how-to/firefly-iii/finances/liabilities.md).

### Optional: buy the house


## Paying your mortgage

### Mortgage payment which is entirely interest
* Create one transaction
  * From asset account to an expense account for interest.

**Note:** You will not see any transactions under your mortgage, nor will it decrease. This is expected, you are not paying towards your mortgage principal.

**Tip:** Depending on your own goals of tracking and granularity, you can either use a shared Expense Account for interest or create a unique expense account for this loan. You would be able to track this over time.

### Mortgage payment is split partly interest and part principal
* Create two transactions, or a single split transaction.
  * Interest is treated as above, from an asset account to an expense account.
  * The principal amount (that will reduce your mortgage), from your asset account to your Mortgage Liability account.

### Mortgage payment is only principal(extra payment to reduce mortgage)
* Create a transaction that goes from your asset account to your liability account.

## Budgets and Categories

It is your choice whether to have separate budgets/categories for interest/principle, or combined, or a mix. 

Depending on your choice, you can leverage the reports for insights over time. Personally, I use one budget for all mortgage transactions, but different categories to show my interest vs principle over time. 

## See the result

Over time, you'll see your mortgage liability account balance decrease as you make principal payments. You can also generate reports to see how much you've paid in interest versus principal over any time period.
