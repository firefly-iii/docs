# FAQ for Docker-related questions

## Where is the Dockerfile?

- [Firefly III](https://dev.azure.com/Firefly-III/_git/MainImage?path=/Dockerfile)
- [Firefly III Data Importer](https://dev.azure.com/Firefly-III/_git/ImportToolImage)
- [Firefly III shared base image](https://dev.azure.com/Firefly-III/_git/BaseImage?path=/apache-8.3/Dockerfile)

## Which Docker tags are available?

The instructions always assume `fireflyiii/core:latest`. This is the latest stable release. Other tags are:

* `fireflyiii/core:beta`. This tag contains beta releases.
* `fireflyiii/core:alpha`. This tag contains alpha releases.
* `fireflyiii/core:develop`. Always the latest develop image. Maybe unstable.

## For which platforms the Firefly III Docker image built?

All Docker tags are built for ARMv7, ARM64 and AMD64. ARMv6 is not included, so these images will *not* work on the Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 1 (A+B) or Raspberry Pi Compute Module.

## How do I set TLS in Firefly III or the data importer?

See [this question](install.md#how-do-i-set-tls-in-firefly-iii-or-the-data-importer).

## It keeps giving me CSP errors

Content Security Policy headers are a security feature, and usually fail when you did not set `TRUSTED_PROXIES=*`.

## All links refer to `http` so forms and charts don't work

This usually happens when you did not set `TRUSTED_PROXIES=*`.

## Which other settings are available for the Docker image?

There are many environment variables that you can set in Firefly III. Just check out the [default env file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/main/.env.example) that lists them all.

## Can I run it under a reverse proxy from a subdirectory?

Yes. For the standard Docker image, follow [these instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/discussions/4892)

> Installed a standalone Apache server, to act as an TLS-terminator.

```
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
<VirtualHost *:443>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        ServerName ...
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../fullchain.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/.../privkey.pem
        Include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-apache.conf

        <Location /accounts>
            ProxyAddHeaders Off
            RequestHeader unset Accept-Encoding
            ProxyPass http://localhost:8087
            ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8087
            AddOutputFilterByType SUBSTITUTE text/html
            Substitute "s|http://localhost:8087/|https://.../accounts/|i"
        </Location>
</VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
```

> `ProxyAddHeaders` is off to prevent Apache sending the X-Forward headers to Firefly III, otherwise the URLs it populates in the response will include the correct website, but not the correct path.

> Unsetting the `Accept-Encoding` header ensures that the response from Firefly III is not compressed, otherwise the `Substitute` directive won't work.

> `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` act as you would expect, so that Firefly III will appear under the "accounts" directory.

> The `AddOutputFilterByType` and `Substitute` directives alter the pages returned from Firefly III, replacing the localhost URLs with the website's URL. Replace "..." with your website address.

## I get 'permission denied' errors on the cache folder

This is caused by a permissions issue. Run the following command:

* `docker exec -it <container> php artisan cache:clear`

Or browse to the `/flush` page in your installation.

## I see a lot of log entries from the "Firefly III Health Checker"

This is normal. The health checker is called by Docker to see if Firefly III is still up and running.

## I get "Function not implemented: AH00141: Could not initialize random number generator"

This is an error that happens on Synology boxes with an old kernel. I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do for you.

## The database password is wrong, but I'm 100% sure it's correct

If you start the database container with a `MYSQL_PASSWORD` that you change later, it won't change in the database. Destroy the volume + container and start over.

This also happens when you start Firefly III for the first time, "to see if it works", and then decide to configure a more secure password.

## I get 'failed to open stream: Permission denied' on log files

This is caused by a permissions issue. Often, this is caused by cron jobs running under root, not `www-data`.

All your Docker commands must run as `www-data`, also in cron jobs:

* `docker exec [container] --user www-data /usr/local/bin/php /var/www/html/artisan firefly-iii:cron`

## How do I debug a cron job on Docker?

Enable [debug mode](../../how-to/general/debug.md). Open a new terminal window, and tail the logs from your Firefly III docker container:

```bash
docker logs -f CONTAINERID
```

Fire the cron job again from another terminal window, with the following command.

```bash
docker exec --user www-data CONTAINERID /usr/local/bin/php /var/www/html/artisan firefly-iii:cron --date=2021-02-01
```

In the command you see a date. Change it to be the first day of the *current* month in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Something about Authentik?

Set the environment variable as follows:

```
AUTHENTICATION_GUARD_HEADER=HTTP_X_AUTHENTIK_EMAIL
```
