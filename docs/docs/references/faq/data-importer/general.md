# General Data Importer questions

## I am being redirected to `http://app` and it doesn't work?

Make sure you set the environment variable `VANITY_URL` and make sure it points to your Firefly III installation. You can leave the `FIREFLY_III_URL` to `http://app:8080` as it is supposed to, but make sure that `VANITY_URL` is set to your actual Firefly III URL.

Press \[Start over\] in the data importer after you've changed the environment variable.
