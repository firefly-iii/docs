# Command line / CLI

Firefly III has a bunch of CLI commands that you can use. Generally speaking these are meant for large operations. Here's a full overview.

See also: [How to use the CLI](../../how-to/firefly-iii/features/cli.md).

## List all commands

`php artisan`

Please note that this will also list all the internal upgrade commands Firefly III uses.

## Apply rules

`php artisan firefly-iii:apply-rules`

This command will apply your rules and rule groups on a selection of your transactions. To use it, add the following parameters:

* `--user[=USER]`. The user ID. [default: "1"]
* `--token[=TOKEN]`. The user's access token. Take this from the `/profile` page.
* `--accounts[=ACCOUNTS]`. A comma-separated list of asset accounts or liabilities to apply your rules to.
* `--rule_groups[=RULE_GROUPS]`. A comma-separated list of rule groups to apply. Take the ID's of these rule groups from the Firefly III interface.
* `--rules[=RULES]`. A comma-separated list of rules to apply. Take the ID's of these rules from the Firefly III interface. Using this option overrules the option that selects rule groups.
* `--all_rules`. If set, will overrule both settings and apply ALL of your rules.
* `--start_date[=START_DATE]`. The date of the earliest transaction to be included (inclusive). If omitted, will be your very first transaction ever. Format: YYYY-MM-DD
* `--end_date[=END_DATE]`. The date of the latest transaction to be included (inclusive). If omitted, will be your latest transaction ever. Format: YYYY-MM-DD
