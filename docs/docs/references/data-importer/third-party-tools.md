# Third-party tools

There are various scripts and tools you can use, if the Firefly III Data Importer does not fit your use case.

!!! info
    These are all developed by other users, feel free to contact them if you have support questions.

!!! info
    Since the data importer supports camt.053 files, this is no necessary.

### GnuCash
