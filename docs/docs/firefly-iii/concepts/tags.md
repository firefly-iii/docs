# Tags

TODO merge with categories budgets tags groups

Tags are an extension of categories and meant to expand on the meta-data included in a transaction. You can add multiple tags to a transaction.

Tags can be useful to group expenses together, possibly in another context than your categories. For examples, tags might include:

* `too-expensive`
* `work-expense`

Or maybe something else entirely. This is up to you.

## Mapbox

You can add a [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API key to your `.env` file which allows you to give tags a location.

## Special tags

When you import data into Firefly III, a special tag will be created for each transaction. It is called `Import with key 'xxxx'` where the key is a custom code every time.
