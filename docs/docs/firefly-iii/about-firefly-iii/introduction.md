# Introduction and features

"Firefly III" is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more.

Personal financial management is pretty difficult, and everybody has their own approach to it. Some people make budgets, other people limit their cash-flow by throwing away their credit cards, others try to *increase* their current cash-flow. There are tons of ways to save and earn money. Firefly III works on the principle that if you know where your money is going, you can stop it from going there.

By keeping track of your expenses and your income you can budget accordingly and save money. Stop living from paycheck to paycheck but give yourself the financial wiggle room you need.

## Who is it for?

This application is for people who want to track their finances, keep an eye on their money **without having to upload their financial records to the cloud**. You're a bit tech-savvy, you like open source software, and you don't mind tinkering with (self-hosted) servers.

Possibly, you're always short on money even though in theory, you make enough money to get by.
