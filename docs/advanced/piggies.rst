Piggy banks
===========

If you want to buy something expensive, you might need to save for it. You can use piggy banks to save money. You can find them under "Money management" > "Piggy banks". A piggy bank is meant to group money on an asset account together.

For example, on your savings account on which you have € 500,- saved. You want to buy a new digital camera, but you also need some money for a new couch and you already know your car is going to break down sooner or later. You would need *three* piggy banks.

1. A piggy bank called "New camera", linked to your savings account. The target amount is € 300,-
2. A piggy bank called "New couch", linked to your savings account. The target amount is € 400,-
3. A piggy bank called "Fix car", linked to your savings account. The target amount is € 1000,-

To do so, use the button to create a new piggy bank. Fill in the details and select the correct asset account. The overview will then show you how your savings are divided over your three piggy banks.

   You can see I have divided almost all my savings over these three piggy banks.
